{"name":"Hl-js-library","tagline":"a easy javascript framework, my first JS framework for study","body":"### A basic Javascript library\r\n\r\nA DOM Library developed developed in 2011 by myself. It is my first pratical experience involving Framework design, Dom manipulation, Lazyload, Javascript extensions and Javascript module loader. Afterward, I determined to become a new front end career path.\r\n\r\n### Intention\r\n\r\nI'm not intent to use it in formal develop environment. It can bring out a great skills enhancement while developing a library, only by native javascript without any framework's supports.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a wonderful playground to test your design pattern and coding abilities, especially when designing a framework. I alwasy believe that, by developing your own framework, it can help developer to figure out the solutions when they face the framework's hard issues.\r\n\r\n* current architecture design: \r\n    * namespace variables in global closure to define various modules (I will discard it recently) ;\r\n    * the main design pattern: Observable, Delegate Events, MVC\r\n* new version is in schedule: \r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Object Oriented Design, provide a Simple Class definition;\r\n* Enhanced Javascript Object prototype: \r\n    * append(mixin), \r\n    * deep clone, \r\n    * array each\r\n* Enhanced Javascript Function prototype, such as: \r\n    * delegate(context bind), \r\n    * defer(setTimeout), \r\n    * buffer(cannot execute in a time range), \r\n    * createInterval\r\n    * intercept: AOP\r\n    * newInstance: simulation of \"new\" syntax\r\n* A simple module criteria. (It will be replace by webpack and CommonJS in next version)\r\n* Dom manipulation, including: create/remove element, find ancestor parent, animation;\r\n\r\n\r\n### UI Components\r\n\r\nVarious traditional UI components extend on ui.Base Class.\r\n\r\n* Accordion\r\n* DigitalClock\r\n* DigitalNumber\r\n* Grid\r\n* Tab\r\n* TreeView \r\n\r\n### Todo list\r\n\r\n* CommonJS module style, built by webpack;\r\n* Promise process;\r\n* High performance aniamtion (RAF, Transition);\r\n* Virtual Dom implementation (similar like React.js);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
